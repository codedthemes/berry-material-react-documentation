## ABOUT BERRY

![Introducing Berry v2.0](.gitbook/assets/doc-v2.0.png)

[Berry](https://berrydashboard.io) is `developer-friendly` & highly customizable React Admin Template based on [Material-UI](http://material-ui.com/).

Berry comes with plenty of ready-to-use Material-UI components that will help you to build your site faster and saves your development time.

Weâ€™ve followed the best industry standards to make our product easy, fast & highly scalable to work with. It's made with this high-end technology stack - React Hooks, Components, Create React App & Redux.

#### Customer Review

> We're just getting started with this new theme, but we liked it enough that we decided to import our application into this codebase rather than the other way around. **Impressive** number of custom components and original work \(vs. some other themes that seem to just be repackaged versions of Material UI\). It is clear the _**developers have put some work in here**_, and we are excited to see what updates are rolled out over the next year.
