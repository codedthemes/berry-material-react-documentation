You donâ€™t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel. They are configured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

## **Pre-requisites**

Berry is based on `node` and `create-react script`. Please check the following **prerequisites** before jump on it.

**Node** is the primary prerequisite for Berry. Open your command terminal and check using the **`node -v`** command

```bash
c:\> node -v
v14.15.4
```

**Package Manager** - npm or yarn

```bash
c:\> yarn -v
1.22.10
```

## **Troubleshooting**

If you face the following error in your terminal, it means **Yarn** is not installed in your system.

```bash
c:\> yarn -v
'yarn' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

Please install it using this [link](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) as it does not come with **Node** automatically.
